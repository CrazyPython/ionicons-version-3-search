# ionicons version 3.0 search

Dynamically search for version 3.0 Ionicons using icon names, tags, and community-added tags to better locate the icon you need.

[Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) by [Drifty](https://github.com/driftyco) is the premium icon font for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), but can be used in any project. It is completely free and open source under an MIT license. The original repo can be accessed [here](https://github.com/driftyco/ionicons/), and switch to branch 3.0 to see version 3.0.

## Community Tag Contributions

Contributions to the community tags are welcome. Add tags to the `communityTags` array for the associated icon in **scripts/icons.js**. Verify the changes are non-breaking - use a JSON linter and run the app locally to test.

To run the site locally, you will need to run a small server. If you have Ruby installed, you can run this tiny server from your command line:
```
$ ruby -run -e httpd . -p 3000
```

Then go to localhost:3000 to view it.
